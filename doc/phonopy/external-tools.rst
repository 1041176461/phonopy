External tools
===============

Here external tools supported by the groups out of phonopy are
listed.

Each of the tools is not supported by the phonopy project because of
the difficulties of the maintainance and the test by main developers
of phonopy under current style of phonopy development. However
useful tools should be known. If developers want to use here to notify
their tools, please contact via the phonopy mainling list.
